# YoutubePlayer
Youtube Player example using Ember, Laravel and the iframe API

This package is just an example case project of using the iframe API with Ember and Laravel, 
not a package that is installed into an existing project.
In order to set up this project you will require Node.js Package Manager, Bower and Composer to install all the dependencies.

## Installation

First you will need to clone this project into your project directory. This example was developed using xampp so the
projects directory is: `C:/xampp/htdocs/`.

Clone into your projects directory using

`git clone https://github.com/Torguise100/YoutubePlayer.git`

Once cloned install all the dependencies used with Ember. 
To do this navigate to the top level of the project and use the following commands:
 
  1) `npm install`
  
  2) `bower install`
  

Next install the Laravel dependencies. Navigate to laravel using:

  `cd laravel/`
  
Then install the dependencies using composer:

  `composer install`
